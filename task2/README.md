## Executing the software:
Move the software/folders inside the same parent directory as 'task2'.
Open a terminal/command line before task2.
cd [Parent_directory]

Before running the file export the classpath for getting the abstractness of a package. 
export CLASSPATH=.:[PATH_TO_PACKAGE_FILE_FOR_ABSTRACTNESS]

javac task2/Input.java
java task2.Input

Note: For calculating abstractness of another package please export the classpath and run the file again.
